# DOG VS CAT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION 
## Overview
This project focuses on classifying images of dogs and cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and can predict whether an image contains a dog or a cat. 

## Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1️. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Dipti-24/Image_Classification.git

cd Image_Classification

2️.Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python (>=3.7) installed. Then, install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️. Download the Dataset
You can use the Kaggle Dogs vs Cats dataset

4.Run the Jupyter Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open Dog_vs_cat.ipynb:
jupyter notebook
Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.

5. Model Training
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
The dataset is preprocessed using image augmentation
Training is performed using TensorFlow/Keras
The model is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics
